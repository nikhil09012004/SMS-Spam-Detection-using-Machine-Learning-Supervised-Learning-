# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an SMS Spam Detection system using supervised machine learning techniques. 
The objective is to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** based on their textual content.
The project demonstrates the practical application of predictive analytics, text preprocessing, 
and classification algorithms covered in the academic syllabus.
